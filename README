Scripts written by Sara Sims (snolin@uab.edu)
Please copy all scripts into your own folders to edit. Visually inspect every step! Don't trust the computer to do it right. 
I generally use "patient" to reference subjects. 

#Registration
BBR registers Diffusion space to freesurfer anatomical space (this needs to be checked using tksurfer gui)

#Freesufer preprocessing
reconall supplies all standard freesurfer outputs

#Making Labels (all labels should be visually inspected as errors are common)
color_tables is just for referencing when putting labels into white matter so don't edit
V1_labeltoindividual
	labels_fsaverage contains all the V1 labels in fsaverage space that need to be in the fsaverage label folder before running V1_label_to_label.m
	V1_label_to_label.m puts V1 segment ROI on the individual
	V1label.job runs the bash script of V1_label_to_label.m through matlab if desired. 
	V1_1.m also puts the first segment of V1 onto the individual, which was not originally included in V1_label_to_label.m
FunctionalNetworks_labeltoindividual
	Yeolabels contains all the network labels in fsaverage space that need to be in the fsaverage label folder before running YeoParcelTransfer.m
	YeoParcelTransfer.m puts network labels on the individual
	Yeosinglesub.m puts network labels on the individual but for just on specified subject, if needed. 
movelabelinto_whitematter (this is where errors are most likely)
	barlabelsV1cortical2wm_HCP.job puts bars #2-8 of V1 into the white matter and then to diffusion space, singlesubject version does it on one person	
	1V1_intowm.job puts bar #1 of V1 into the white matter and then to diffusion space
	V1segmentlabel_cortical2wm puts central, mid, and far V1 into white matter and then to diffusion space
	label_V1cortical2wmnewfar67_HCP.job creates a smaller version of the far label with  just bars #6&7
	label_FNcortical2wm_HCP.job puts Yeo networks into the white matter and then to diffusion space, singlesubject version does it on one person
labelstovolumes_notinwhitematter
	labelFNcorticaltovol_HCP.job puts Yeo networks in the cortical ribbon/grey matter as a volume
addinglabelstogether
	add1tocentralV1.job add bar #1 to the central (2&3) ROI
	allFNROI.job adds together all the networks into one ROI
	wholebrainROI.job makes an ROI of the whole brain using the network ROIs
	wholeV1ROI.job make an ROI of the entire V1 using the eccentricity segments
	Other scripts can help when there are errors in label creation, ex- merge, labelconcatforremakinglabel.job, etc...
Labelchecking
	reconlabel_checking_script can be used to automatically open labels in freeview for checking
	concatlabelforchecking.m generates a script of all the subjects labels which can then be fed into...
	1V1check.job and 67V1check.job which concatenate all the label files into one volume that you can put into freeview to check

#Diffusion preprocessing (topup had already been run on the HCP data, so you will need to run that if your data hasn't had distortion corrected using topup)
bedpost_gpu.job runs bedpost on subjects using gpu node
Alternatively bed.job runs on a compute node (not reccommended)
	if at first it doesn't succeed for a subject, rerun using provided scripts. However, you will need to delete the previously created bedpost folder, to delete alot of them at once, use bedpostcleanup.m 

#Probtrackx
each ...prob_HCP.job runs the ..s as the seed and the ..t as the target as a classification target, 10,000 (or 5000) streamlines, loopcheck, and distance correction
within the postbrobreg folder, find the corresponding folder to the probtrackx run:
	FOLLOW THE NUMBER SEQUENCE OR IT WILL NOT WORK and there is a set that corresponds to each run of probtrackx
	1findbiggestclass.job runs find_the_biggest on the probtrackx run for whole FN and whole V1, this is not needed for other runs
	2probout2structtransform.job puts the output of probtrackx into the the subject's anatomical space
	3convertprob_log.job gets track probabilities by dividing the image by the max log
	4vol2surf.job puts the track probabilities data onto the surface from 1mm below
	5fsavg_smooth.job convert the track probabilites on the individual surface to fsaverage space and smooths
	6group_averagesurf.job creates a group average in fsaverage space surface
	7mni152reg_HCP.job creates registration matrix for anatomical to MNI space and then puts the probtrackx outputs that are in anatomical space into MNI space
	8group_averaging_MNI is a set of scripts to generate MNI group averages of the track probabilities, follow the letter sequencing

#diff_analysis
contains jobs that run various kinds of analyses including comparisons in volume and surface space. See readme file within the folder.
